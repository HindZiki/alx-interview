The project focuses on locked boxes (lockboxes), and the goal is to determine whether all the boxes can be opened using Python. Key concepts such as list manipulation, graph theory, recursion, and data structures like stacks and queues will be helpful in developing the solution.

The problem requires checking if, starting from the first unlocked box (box 0), all other boxes can be opened using the keys found in previously opened boxes. Approaches involving graph traversal, either depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), may be applied to efficiently solve this challenge.
